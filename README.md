# MinesSeeker

*Copyright (C) 2018 - Carlos Enrique Pérez Sánchez*

**MinesSeeker is a minesweeper-like game.**


This minesweeper it's a school project. It uses Qt: QML for the UI, and C++ for the logic. Can be compiled to all major desktop platform and (maybe, not tested yet) for Android and iOS. It has been extensively tested on Windows and Linux for several users on my school. I haven't tested it on a Mac yet.  
Enjoy!
