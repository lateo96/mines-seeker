# TODO LIST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## KNOWN BUGS
1. The app cannot run in most android devices because it consumes too much memory
2. After a language change, the text on dialog's buttons doesn't get updated properly (maybe a Qt Bug?...)
3. (...) And once updated, some buttons are moved partially outside their parent dialog (maybe a Qt Bug?...)

## PENDING
1. Make the UIBoard a Table View
2. Deploy to android devices
2. Make a class to manage styles
3. Add option to generate only games that can be resolved without gessing
